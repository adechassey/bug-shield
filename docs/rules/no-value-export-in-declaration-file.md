# This rule forbids exporting values from TypeScript declaration files (ending in ".d.ts"), which can lead to bugs since these files are dropped during transpilation (`@hokla/custom-rules/no-value-export-in-declaration-file`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the ðŸ¤“ `all` [config](https://github.com/hokla-org/eslint-plugin-custom-rules).
