# This rule forbids exporting values from TypeScript declaration files (ending in ".d.ts"), which can lead to bugs since these files are dropped during transpilation (`@hokla/bug-shield/no-value-export-in-declaration-file`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the ☑️ `recommended` [config](https://github.com/hokla-org/eslint-plugin-bug-shield).
